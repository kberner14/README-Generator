## READ-ME Generator

# Description

* An integral part of any project is the construction of a READ-ME file. It should be the beginning and end step of any project to set up parameters for where you are headed, and what you have accomplished. In this project, I will be creating an application that will dynamically construct a READ-ME file based on answers to generated questions and information pulled from their GitHub repository.

# Goals

* Create a READ-ME generator to be used on future projects
* Have it dynamically sift through github to pick information for file
* Have it prompt user and place user inputs into contextual places
* Use import and export to create and fold in functions from other js files
* Use NPM functionalities to help with prompting user interaction
* Use axios to get github information based on user answers to questions

# Challenges

* Using the github api sent me for a loop, and not a for loop.
* Working with module exports and imports was a good test of syntax. Was difficult, but eventually I think I got it down.
* Structuring the response synchronosly. I still don't know whether I'm doing this correctly. Need to work on that more.

# Things That Need Touch Ups

* Definitely the API, couldn't get it working.

* I think the synchronicity, now that we're learning more about how that works.

* Overall refactoring to get everything to line up as it should. A few things bothering me with that but was mostly concentrating on functionality.

* After getting API to work, need to comb through it for all the data that I need.
